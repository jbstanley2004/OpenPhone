## Overview
Quo API webhooks allow developers to receive real-time notifications for various events, such as calls, messages, and transcripts. By integrating webhooks into your workflows, you can automate processes, enhance user experiences, and seamlessly connect Quo with other systems.

<Note>**Important note:** Webhooks created in the Quo app are not compatible with those created via the API. You cannot access or modify app webhooks through the API, or API webhooks in the app.</Note>
