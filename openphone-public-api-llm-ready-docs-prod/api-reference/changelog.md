### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue with list calls (`GET /calls`) where sending an empty participants param resulted in a 500 response. Sending an empty participants param will now result in a descriptive 400 response.
- Fixes an issue where attempting to send a message to an international number would result in a 500 response if international messaging is not enabled in the workspace. With this fix, the 500 error response changed to a 403 with a descriptive message
- Fixes a bug where the GET call recordings endpoint sometimes returned an empty array.
- Fixes an issue that was preventing some call records from returning successfully from `GET /calls`
- Fixes an issue where getting a contact by id would result in a 500 instead of a 404 when contact is not found. Now this will respond in a 404 with a descriptive message.
- Fixes an issue where sending a message that contained only whitespace (`' '`, `'\n'`, etc.) resulted in a 500 error response. Now, this will respond with 400 and a validation error message instead.

Changes from the beta version include:

- The `since` query parameter on "list calls" and "list messages" has been deprecated. It used to incorrectly behave as a `createdBefore`. Please use `createdAfter` instead, or `createdBefore` to maintain current functionality.
- The `phoneNumberId` field for "send text message" has been deprecated. Please use `from` instead.
- `/v0` endpoints have been deprecated. Please use `/v1` instead.
