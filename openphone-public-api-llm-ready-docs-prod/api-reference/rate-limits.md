Each API key may make up to **10 requests per second.**

Exceeding this limit may result in `429` status code errors. If you'd like to request a higher rate limit, reach out to us at support+developers@quo.com.

<Tip>
Implement request throttling in your application to stay within rate limits and optimize API usage.
